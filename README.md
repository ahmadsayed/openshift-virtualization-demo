# Unboxing OpenShift Virtualization 

OpenShift Virtualization is Redhat OpenShift features based on Kubevirt.

Before getting to what is kubevirt let us answer what kubevirt is not

* KubeVirt is not a competitor to Firecracker or Kata containers
* KubeVirt is not a container runtime replacement

## So Kubevirt will be  [defined as following](https://kubevirt.io/2020/KubeVirt_deep_dive-virtualized_gpu_workloads.html)

KubeVirt is a Kubernetes extension that allows running traditional VM workloads natively side by side with Container workloads.

## Why KubeVirt.

Practically all workloads originally host on VM, and even moving to Containers some stubborn workloads still prefer to stay on VM so we ends on the below architecture

Even more in may cases we run OpenShift on Virtual Machines, so we will ends up with the below archeticutre

## What is the problem with previous diagrams 

* Multiple Stacks
* Multipe Skill sets.
* Inter communication and network policies between VM and containers getting more complex

## So What Kubevirt is trying to achieve 

Managed Both Cotnainers and VM with the Same Control plan

## Advantage of this approach 

* Converging VM management into container management workflows
* Using the same tooling (kubectl) for containers and Virtual Machines
* Keeping the declarative API for VM management (just like pods, deployments, etcâ€¦)

## How Virtual machines defined in Kubevirt

```
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachineInstance
...
 spec:
  domain:
   cpu:
    cores: 2
   devices:
    disk: fedora29
```    
### Looks Familiar  ...

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## What does it mean?

One Control Plan, Same Skillset and ... One Platform.

## Architecture 

Kubevirt is KVM+qemu process running inside the a pod but... 

### What is QEMU?

[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)  is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

Run QEMU on your machines, just download the process and run it 

QEMU Demo 

### Create hardisk with qemu-img 

```
qemu-img.exe create -f qcow2 test.qcow2  5G
```
### Run the Linux and from iso and point it to the disk 
```
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -boot d -cdrom Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-32-1.6.iso -hda test.qcow2 -m 2048m -device bochs-display
```

### What is KVM?

[KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page)  is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V).

What do we need to do to use KVM just add 

```
--accel kvm
```

Because I am running on windows I will use similar technology called [Intel HAXM](https://github.com/intel/haxm)
```
--accel hax
```

The command will become 

```
qemu-system-x86_64.exe -boot d -cdrom Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-32-1.6.iso -hda test.qcow2 -m 2048m -device bochs-display -accel hax
```

## Looking again at Kubevirt Architecutre 


![Simple](https://kubevirt.io/assets/2020-02-06-KubeVirt_deep_dive-virtualized_gpu_workloads/kubevirt_virtual_machine.png)

The VM Launch flow is shown in the following diagram. Since the user posts a VM manifest to the cluster until the Kubelet spins up the VM pod. And finally the virt-handler instructs the virt-launcher how to launch the qemu.

## What about the Storage?

Unlike The virtual Machines where we have custom resources for Virtual Machines Storage is exactly the same for Kubernetes
* Persistence Volume.
* Persistence Volume Claim.

# Demo - Getting Start with OpenShift Virtualization 
* Install OpenShift Virtualization
* Create Hybrid Converged Cluster
* Show how to enable disable emulation mode(Remember the accel before ;) )
* Login to the node and check the qemu process running
